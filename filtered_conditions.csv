ADHD occurs across all races and socioeconomic groups. Symptoms can be grouped depending on the predominant behavior. Examples of inattentive behavior include: Being easily distracted Daydreaming Disorganization Making silly mistakes Often late Short attention span. Examples of hyperactive behavior include: Constantly moving Fidgeting High energy levels Restlessness Trouble sitting still Trouble switching off/sleeping. Examples of impulsive behavior include: Acting without thinking Blurting out answers/secrets Interrupting Prone to accidents. Other symptoms that are common to people with ADHD include: Creativity High Intelligence Delayed social maturity Enthusiasm Sensitivity. What Causes ADHD? The causes of ADHD are not fully known, but research is actively ongoing. There does appear to be a link between a family history of ADHD (genetics) with over 25% of relatives of families with a child with ADHD who also had the condition. There is also an 82% chance that identical twins will both have ADHD if at least one of them has the condition compared to a 38% chance among fraternal twins. Other factors that have been identified as possibly contributing to ADHD include: Brain injury from a traumatic event (eg, stroke, head trauma, tumor) Exposure to lead after birth Low birth weight Fetal exposure to alcohol or cigarette smoke Herbicides Pesticides. There is no evidence that poor parenting, certain foods, sugar, or vaccinations cause ADHD. How is ADHD Diagnosed? If your child has symptoms suggestive of ADHD then talk with your doctor or pediatrician. They will talk with you, your child, and possibly your child’s school and ask questions that focus on: Ability to control emotions Attentiveness Focus Home and school relationships Hyperactivity. They will ask if your family has any other family members with ADHD. Most cases of ADHD are diagnosed at age 7 or 8, but symptoms may begin sooner. ADHD usually still persists into adulthood; however, some people have learned how to manage their symptoms better so it may not be as noticeable. How is ADHD Treated? Behavioral education should be considered as first-line treatment for any case of ADHD, particularly in children aged less than 6 years of age, with mild symptoms, or if the family prefers this option over drug therapy.

What are the Symptoms of ADHD? Each person varies in the severity and frequency of their symptoms. Originally it was thought that ADHD was more common in boys; however, experts believe girls are more likely to present with inattentive characteristics and are more likely overlooked. ADHD occurs across all races and socioeconomic groups. Symptoms can be grouped depending on the predominant behavior. Examples of inattentive behavior include: Being easily distracted Daydreaming Disorganization Making silly mistakes Often late Short attention span. Examples of hyperactive behavior include: Constantly moving Fidgeting High energy levels Restlessness Trouble sitting still Trouble switching off/sleeping. Examples of impulsive behavior include: Acting without thinking Blurting out answers/secrets Interrupting Prone to accidents.

The causes of ADHD are not fully known, but research is actively ongoing. There does appear to be a link between a family history of ADHD (genetics) with over 25% of relatives of families with a child with ADHD who also had the condition. There is also an 82% chance that identical twins will both have ADHD if at least one of them has the condition compared to a 38% chance among fraternal twins. Other factors that have been identified as possibly contributing to ADHD include: Brain injury from a traumatic event (eg, stroke, head trauma, tumor) Exposure to lead after birth Low birth weight Fetal exposure to alcohol or cigarette smoke Herbicides Pesticides. There is no evidence that poor parenting, certain foods, sugar, or vaccinations cause ADHD. How is ADHD Diagnosed? If your child has symptoms suggestive of ADHD then talk with your doctor or pediatrician. They will talk with you, your child, and possibly your child’s school and ask questions that focus on: Ability to control emotions Attentiveness Focus Home and school relationships Hyperactivity. They will ask if your family has any other family members with ADHD. Most cases of ADHD are diagnosed at age 7 or 8, but symptoms may begin sooner. ADHD usually still persists into adulthood; however, some people have learned how to manage their symptoms better so it may not be as noticeable. How is ADHD Treated? Behavioral education should be considered as first-line treatment for any case of ADHD, particularly in children aged less than 6 years of age, with mild symptoms, or if the family prefers this option over drug therapy.

Examples of inattentive behavior include: Being easily distracted Daydreaming Disorganization Making silly mistakes Often late Short attention span. Examples of hyperactive behavior include: Constantly moving Fidgeting High energy levels Restlessness Trouble sitting still Trouble switching off/sleeping.

There is no evidence that poor parenting, certain foods, sugar, or vaccinations cause ADHD. How is ADHD Diagnosed? If your child has symptoms suggestive of ADHD then talk with your doctor or pediatrician. They will talk with you, your child, and possibly your child’s school and ask questions that focus on: Ability to control emotions Attentiveness Focus Home and school relationships Hyperactivity. They will ask if your family has any other family members with ADHD. Most cases of ADHD are diagnosed at age 7 or 8, but symptoms may begin sooner. ADHD usually still persists into adulthood; however, some people have learned how to manage their symptoms better so it may not be as noticeable. How is ADHD Treated?

It may also be called nervousness. Occasional anxiety concerning a stressful or uncomfortable event is normal. However, if a person feels disproportionate levels of anxiety or it is present almost continuously, it might be diagnosed as an anxiety disorder. What Causes Anxiety? Anxiety is part of our survival response and is the way our body responds to potentially harmful or worrying triggers. Strong emotions or fear cause a surge of epinephrine (also called adrenaline) from our adrenal glands. This increases our heartbeat, increases our sensitivity to our surroundings, and prepares us for physical confrontation or to flee if we perceive any threats to our safety. This is often called the fight or flight response. Anxieties today mostly revolve around family, friends, health, money, or work. People more at risk of anxiety disorders include those: With relationship problems Whose jobs involve long hours, high workloads, little support, or danger With family members with anxiety disorders With medical conditions that result in significant lifestyle adjustments, pain, or restricted movement Who have experienced stressful or traumatic events Withdrawing from alcohol, opioids, or other substances. What are the Symptoms of an Anxiety Disorder? Symptoms of an anxiety disorder are usually out of proportion to the original trigger or stressor. If these are accompanied by significant physical symptoms such as increased sweating or increased blood pressure then a person is more likely to have an anxiety disorder rather than stimulus-appropriate anxiety. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a chronic, ongoing condition with excessive worry over normal life events, whether minor or major. These feelings are usually out of proportion to the trouble that you may encounter in your everyday life. With GAD, feelings come on gradually and are present each day, not in one individual attack, and last for months, even years. Worry may be so excessive that it interferes with your daily life. GAD may also be accompanied by depression and substance abuse disorders. Symptoms of GAD include: Excessive and uncontrollable worry Increased irritability Difficulty concentrating Restlessness or a feeling of being on edge Rapid breathing Excessive perspiration and sweating Trembling, quivering Fatigue Trouble concentrating Headaches, stomach upset Avoidance of circumstances that might trigger severe anxiety Sleep difficulties. Other anxiety disorders include panic disorder, phobias, selective mutism, social anxiety disorder, and separation anxiety disorder. How is Anxiety or an Anxiety Disorder Treated? Treatment depends on the severity and type of anxiety disorder and if it is interfering with everyday life. Treatments may include: Stress management Relaxation techniques Mental imagery (replacing negative thoughts with positive ones) Cognitive Behavioral therapy Counseling Support Exercise Medications.",8.5,552.0,https://www.drugs.com/xanax.html,https://www.drugs.com/condition/anxiety.html

This increases our heartbeat, increases our sensitivity to our surroundings, and prepares us for physical confrontation or to flee if we perceive any threats to our safety. This is often called the fight or flight response. Anxieties today mostly revolve around family, friends, health, money, or work. People more at risk of anxiety disorders include those: With relationship problems Whose jobs involve long hours, high workloads, little support, or danger With family members with anxiety disorders With medical conditions that result in significant lifestyle adjustments, pain, or restricted movement Who have experienced stressful or traumatic events Withdrawing from alcohol, opioids, or other substances. What are the Symptoms of an Anxiety Disorder? Symptoms of an anxiety disorder are usually out of proportion to the original trigger or stressor. If these are accompanied by significant physical symptoms such as increased sweating or increased blood pressure then a person is more likely to have an anxiety disorder rather than stimulus-appropriate anxiety. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a chronic, ongoing condition with excessive worry over normal life events, whether minor or major. These feelings are usually out of proportion to the trouble that you may encounter in your everyday life. With GAD, feelings come on gradually and are present each day, not in one individual attack, and last for months, even years. Worry may be so excessive that it interferes with your daily life. GAD may also be accompanied by depression and substance abuse disorders. Symptoms of GAD include: Excessive and uncontrollable worry Increased irritability Difficulty concentrating Restlessness or a feeling of being on edge Rapid breathing Excessive perspiration and sweating Trembling, quivering Fatigue Trouble concentrating Headaches, stomach upset Avoidance of circumstances that might trigger severe anxiety Sleep difficulties. Other anxiety disorders include panic disorder, phobias, selective mutism, social anxiety disorder, and separation anxiety disorder. How is Anxiety or an Anxiety Disorder Treated?

People with bipolar disorder fluctuate from feeling down and depressed to feeling super-charged or manic. The disorder used to be called manic depression or manic-depressive illness. However, nowadays, several types of bipolar disorder are recognized: bipolar I, bipolar II, cyclothymic disorder, mixed features, and rapid-cycling disorder. What are the Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder? Symptoms vary among people with bipolar disorder, depending on what type of bipolar disorder they have. All have slightly different symptoms. Symptoms reflect mood opposites and may include: Periods of high or irritable mood High energy levels Scattered and unproductive activity sometimes with painful or embarrassing consequences Little, if any, need for sleep Thinking that is out of step with reality Psychotic symptoms, such as false beliefs (delusions) or false perceptions (hallucinations) Very low mood Deep depression Self-loathing Feelings of hopelessness or despair Refusal to get out of bed. Some people only develop milder symptoms of mania without psychotic symptoms. This is called hypomania. People who don’t have full blown episodes of mania are more likely to have bipolar II disorder. These mood swings are much more severe than the normal ups and downs most people go through. In between mood swings, most people with bipolar disorder can lead relatively normal lives. The time spent in each mood state (ie, mania or depression) varies depending on the type of bipolar disorder but can range from days to months. The severity of the mood state can also vary significantly, with some people only ever experiencing mild symptoms. What Causes Bipolar Disorder? Although the exact cause is unknown, there does seem to be a genetic link, and you are more likely to get bipolar disorder if you have another family member with the condition. Symptoms are often triggered by a stressful situation or circumstance. This may take the form of a relationship breakdown; physical, sexual, or emotional abuse; money problems; or the death of a close family member or loved one. Symptoms are thought to be due to changes in the balance of some neurotransmitters in the brain, specifically noradrenaline, serotonin, and dopamine. It can be hard to recognize bipolar disorder initially. During a manic phase, a person with bipolar disorder may be incredibly fun to be around. However, as the condition progresses, these manic episodes become more extreme. Some people with bipolar disorder only experience slight mania and are mainly depressed. Misdiagnosis as depression is common. If an antidepressant is prescribed without a mood stabilizer, it will often catapult the person into a full-on manic state. Recognizing bipolar illness is important for treatment, as mood stabilizing agents are the best type of medication. How is Bipolar Disorder Treated? Bipolar disorder can be treated. For best results, medication needs to be combined with therapy sessions and the instigation of good routines. The most effective treatment for bipolar disorder is a mood stabilizing agent. These medications even out the troughs and the peaks of mood swings to keep you on a more even keel. Other treatments may include antipsychotics or antidepressants. Medications should be combined with nonpharmacological treatments, such as: Cognitive-behavioral therapy: This looks into any negative thought patterns you may have and challenges them in order to change your behavior.

People with bipolar disorder fluctuate from feeling down and depressed to feeling super-charged or manic. The disorder used to be called manic depression or manic-depressive illness. However, nowadays, several types of bipolar disorder are recognized: bipolar I, bipolar II, cyclothymic disorder, mixed features, and rapid-cycling disorder.

Some people only develop milder symptoms of mania without psychotic symptoms. This is called hypomania. People who don’t have full blown episodes of mania are more likely to have bipolar II disorder.

The time spent in each mood state (ie, mania or depression) varies depending on the type of bipolar disorder but can range from days to months. The severity of the mood state can also vary significantly, with some people only ever experiencing mild symptoms. What Causes Bipolar Disorder? Although the exact cause is unknown, there does seem to be a genetic link, and you are more likely to get bipolar disorder if you have another family member with the condition. Symptoms are often triggered by a stressful situation or circumstance. This may take the form of a relationship breakdown; physical, sexual, or emotional abuse; money problems; or the death of a close family member or loved one. Symptoms are thought to be due to changes in the balance of some neurotransmitters in the brain, specifically noradrenaline, serotonin, and dopamine.

People with bipolar disorder fluctuate from feeling down and depressed to feeling super-charged or manic. The disorder used to be called manic depression or manic-depressive illness. However, nowadays, several types of bipolar disorder are recognized: bipolar I, bipolar II, cyclothymic disorder, mixed features, and rapid-cycling disorder. What are the Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder? Symptoms vary among people with bipolar disorder, depending on what type of bipolar disorder they have. All have slightly different symptoms. Symptoms reflect mood opposites and may include: Periods of high or irritable mood High energy levels Scattered and unproductive activity sometimes with painful or embarrassing consequences Little, if any, need for sleep Thinking that is out of step with reality Psychotic symptoms, such as false beliefs (delusions) or false perceptions (hallucinations) Very low mood Deep depression Self-loathing Feelings of hopelessness or despair Refusal to get out of bed. Some people only develop milder symptoms of mania without psychotic symptoms. This is called hypomania. People who don’t have full blown episodes of mania are more likely to have bipolar II disorder. These mood swings are much more severe than the normal ups and downs most people go through. In between mood swings, most people with bipolar disorder can lead relatively normal lives. The time spent in each mood state (ie, mania or depression) varies depending on the type of bipolar disorder but can range from days to months. The severity of the mood state can also vary significantly, with some people only ever experiencing mild symptoms. What Causes Bipolar Disorder? Although the exact cause is unknown, there does seem to be a genetic link, and you are more likely to get bipolar disorder if you have another family member with the condition. Symptoms are often triggered by a stressful situation or circumstance. This may take the form of a relationship breakdown; physical, sexual, or emotional abuse; money problems; or the death of a close family member or loved one. Symptoms are thought to be due to changes in the balance of some neurotransmitters in the brain, specifically noradrenaline, serotonin, and dopamine. It can be hard to recognize bipolar disorder initially. During a manic phase, a person with bipolar disorder may be incredibly fun to be around. However, as the condition progresses, these manic episodes become more extreme. Some people with bipolar disorder only experience slight mania and are mainly depressed. Misdiagnosis as depression is common. If an antidepressant is prescribed without a mood stabilizer, it will often catapult the person into a full-on manic state. Recognizing bipolar illness is important for treatment, as mood stabilizing agents are the best type of medication. How is Bipolar Disorder Treated? Bipolar disorder can be treated. For best results, medication needs to be combined with therapy sessions and the instigation of good routines. The most effective treatment for bipolar disorder is a mood stabilizing agent.

What are the Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder? Symptoms vary among people with bipolar disorder, depending on what type of bipolar disorder they have. All have slightly different symptoms. Symptoms reflect mood opposites and may include: Periods of high or irritable mood High energy levels Scattered and unproductive activity sometimes with painful or embarrassing consequences Little, if any, need for sleep Thinking that is out of step with reality Psychotic symptoms, such as false beliefs (delusions) or false perceptions (hallucinations) Very low mood Deep depression Self-loathing Feelings of hopelessness or despair Refusal to get out of bed. Some people only develop milder symptoms of mania without psychotic symptoms. This is called hypomania. People who don’t have full blown episodes of mania are more likely to have bipolar II disorder. These mood swings are much more severe than the normal ups and downs most people go through. In between mood swings, most people with bipolar disorder can lead relatively normal lives. The time spent in each mood state (ie, mania or depression) varies depending on the type of bipolar disorder but can range from days to months. The severity of the mood state can also vary significantly, with some people only ever experiencing mild symptoms. What Causes Bipolar Disorder? Although the exact cause is unknown, there does seem to be a genetic link, and you are more likely to get bipolar disorder if you have another family member with the condition. Symptoms are often triggered by a stressful situation or circumstance. This may take the form of a relationship breakdown; physical, sexual, or emotional abuse; money problems; or the death of a close family member or loved one. Symptoms are thought to be due to changes in the balance of some neurotransmitters in the brain, specifically noradrenaline, serotonin, and dopamine. It can be hard to recognize bipolar disorder initially. During a manic phase, a person with bipolar disorder may be incredibly fun to be around. However, as the condition progresses, these manic episodes become more extreme. Some people with bipolar disorder only experience slight mania and are mainly depressed. Misdiagnosis as depression is common. If an antidepressant is prescribed without a mood stabilizer, it will often catapult the person into a full-on manic state. Recognizing bipolar illness is important for treatment, as mood stabilizing agents are the best type of medication. How is Bipolar Disorder Treated? Bipolar disorder can be treated. For best results, medication needs to be combined with therapy sessions and the instigation of good routines. The most effective treatment for bipolar disorder is a mood stabilizing agent. These medications even out the troughs and the peaks of mood swings to keep you on a more even keel. Other treatments may include antipsychotics or antidepressants. Medications should be combined with nonpharmacological treatments, such as: Cognitive-behavioral therapy: This looks into any negative thought patterns you may have and challenges them in order to change your behavior. Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy: This aims to improve disruptions to your biological or social rhythms (such as sleep disturbances and relationship issues).

People with bipolar disorder fluctuate from feeling down and depressed to feeling super-charged or manic. The disorder used to be called manic depression or manic-depressive illness. However, nowadays, several types of bipolar disorder are recognized: bipolar I, bipolar II, cyclothymic disorder, mixed features, and rapid-cycling disorder. What are the Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder? Symptoms vary among people with bipolar disorder, depending on what type of bipolar disorder they have. All have slightly different symptoms. Symptoms reflect mood opposites and may include: Periods of high or irritable mood High energy levels Scattered and unproductive activity sometimes with painful or embarrassing consequences Little, if any, need for sleep Thinking that is out of step with reality Psychotic symptoms, such as false beliefs (delusions) or false perceptions (hallucinations) Very low mood Deep depression Self-loathing Feelings of hopelessness or despair Refusal to get out of bed. Some people only develop milder symptoms of mania without psychotic symptoms. This is called hypomania. People who don’t have full blown episodes of mania are more likely to have bipolar II disorder. These mood swings are much more severe than the normal ups and downs most people go through. In between mood swings, most people with bipolar disorder can lead relatively normal lives. The time spent in each mood state (ie, mania or depression) varies depending on the type of bipolar disorder but can range from days to months. The severity of the mood state can also vary significantly, with some people only ever experiencing mild symptoms. What Causes Bipolar Disorder? Although the exact cause is unknown, there does seem to be a genetic link, and you are more likely to get bipolar disorder if you have another family member with the condition. Symptoms are often triggered by a stressful situation or circumstance. This may take the form of a relationship breakdown; physical, sexual, or emotional abuse; money problems; or the death of a close family member or loved one. Symptoms are thought to be due to changes in the balance of some neurotransmitters in the brain, specifically noradrenaline, serotonin, and dopamine. It can be hard to recognize bipolar disorder initially. During a manic phase, a person with bipolar disorder may be incredibly fun to be around. However, as the condition progresses, these manic episodes become more extreme. Some people with bipolar disorder only experience slight mania and are mainly depressed. Misdiagnosis as depression is common. If an antidepressant is prescribed without a mood stabilizer, it will often catapult the person into a full-on manic state. Recognizing bipolar illness is important for treatment, as mood stabilizing agents are the best type of medication. How is Bipolar Disorder Treated? Bipolar disorder can be treated. For best results, medication needs to be combined with therapy sessions and the instigation of good routines. The most effective treatment for bipolar disorder is a mood stabilizing agent. These medications even out the troughs and the peaks of mood swings to keep you on a more even keel. Other treatments may include antipsychotics or antidepressants. Medications should be combined with nonpharmacological treatments, such as: Cognitive-behavioral therapy: This looks into any negative thought patterns you may have and challenges them in order to change your behavior.

People with bipolar disorder fluctuate from feeling down and depressed to feeling super-charged or manic. The disorder used to be called manic depression or manic-depressive illness. However, nowadays, several types of bipolar disorder are recognized: bipolar I, bipolar II, cyclothymic disorder, mixed features, and rapid-cycling disorder. What are the Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder? Symptoms vary among people with bipolar disorder, depending on what type of bipolar disorder they have. All have slightly different symptoms. Symptoms reflect mood opposites and may include: Periods of high or irritable mood High energy levels Scattered and unproductive activity sometimes with painful or embarrassing consequences Little, if any, need for sleep Thinking that is out of step with reality Psychotic symptoms, such as false beliefs (delusions) or false perceptions (hallucinations) Very low mood Deep depression Self-loathing Feelings of hopelessness or despair Refusal to get out of bed. Some people only develop milder symptoms of mania without psychotic symptoms. This is called hypomania. People who don’t have full blown episodes of mania are more likely to have bipolar II disorder. These mood swings are much more severe than the normal ups and downs most people go through. In between mood swings, most people with bipolar disorder can lead relatively normal lives. The time spent in each mood state (ie, mania or depression) varies depending on the type of bipolar disorder but can range from days to months. The severity of the mood state can also vary significantly, with some people only ever experiencing mild symptoms. What Causes Bipolar Disorder? Although the exact cause is unknown, there does seem to be a genetic link, and you are more likely to get bipolar disorder if you have another family member with the condition. Symptoms are often triggered by a stressful situation or circumstance. This may take the form of a relationship breakdown; physical, sexual, or emotional abuse; money problems; or the death of a close family member or loved one. Symptoms are thought to be due to changes in the balance of some neurotransmitters in the brain, specifically noradrenaline, serotonin, and dopamine. It can be hard to recognize bipolar disorder initially. During a manic phase, a person with bipolar disorder may be incredibly fun to be around. However, as the condition progresses, these manic episodes become more extreme. Some people with bipolar disorder only experience slight mania and are mainly depressed. Misdiagnosis as depression is common. If an antidepressant is prescribed without a mood stabilizer, it will often catapult the person into a full-on manic state. Recognizing bipolar illness is important for treatment, as mood stabilizing agents are the best type of medication. How is Bipolar Disorder Treated? Bipolar disorder can be treated. For best results, medication needs to be combined with therapy sessions and the instigation of good routines. The most effective treatment for bipolar disorder is a mood stabilizing agent. These medications even out the troughs and the peaks of mood swings to keep you on a more even keel. Other treatments may include antipsychotics or antidepressants. Medications should be combined with nonpharmacological treatments, such as: Cognitive-behavioral therapy: This looks into any negative thought patterns you may have and challenges them in order to change your behavior. Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy: This aims to improve disruptions to your biological or social rhythms (such as sleep disturbances and relationship issues).

People with bipolar disorder fluctuate from feeling down and depressed to feeling super-charged or manic. The disorder used to be called manic depression or manic-depressive illness. However, nowadays, several types of bipolar disorder are recognized: bipolar I, bipolar II, cyclothymic disorder, mixed features, and rapid-cycling disorder. What are the Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder? Symptoms vary among people with bipolar disorder, depending on what type of bipolar disorder they have. All have slightly different symptoms. Symptoms reflect mood opposites and may include: Periods of high or irritable mood High energy levels Scattered and unproductive activity sometimes with painful or embarrassing consequences Little, if any, need for sleep Thinking that is out of step with reality Psychotic symptoms, such as false beliefs (delusions) or false perceptions (hallucinations) Very low mood Deep depression Self-loathing Feelings of hopelessness or despair Refusal to get out of bed. Some people only develop milder symptoms of mania without psychotic symptoms. This is called hypomania. People who don’t have full blown episodes of mania are more likely to have bipolar II disorder. These mood swings are much more severe than the normal ups and downs most people go through. In between mood swings, most people with bipolar disorder can lead relatively normal lives. The time spent in each mood state (ie, mania or depression) varies depending on the type of bipolar disorder but can range from days to months. The severity of the mood state can also vary significantly, with some people only ever experiencing mild symptoms. What Causes Bipolar Disorder? Although the exact cause is unknown, there does seem to be a genetic link, and you are more likely to get bipolar disorder if you have another family member with the condition. Symptoms are often triggered by a stressful situation or circumstance. This may take the form of a relationship breakdown; physical, sexual, or emotional abuse; money problems; or the death of a close family member or loved one. Symptoms are thought to be due to changes in the balance of some neurotransmitters in the brain, specifically noradrenaline, serotonin, and dopamine. It can be hard to recognize bipolar disorder initially. During a manic phase, a person with bipolar disorder may be incredibly fun to be around. However, as the condition progresses, these manic episodes become more extreme. Some people with bipolar disorder only experience slight mania and are mainly depressed. Misdiagnosis as depression is common. If an antidepressant is prescribed without a mood stabilizer, it will often catapult the person into a full-on manic state. Recognizing bipolar illness is important for treatment, as mood stabilizing agents are the best type of medication. How is Bipolar Disorder Treated? Bipolar disorder can be treated. For best results, medication needs to be combined with therapy sessions and the instigation of good routines. The most effective treatment for bipolar disorder is a mood stabilizing agent. These medications even out the troughs and the peaks of mood swings to keep you on a more even keel. Other treatments may include antipsychotics or antidepressants. Medications should be combined with nonpharmacological treatments, such as: Cognitive-behavioral therapy: This looks into any negative thought patterns you may have and challenges them in order to change your behavior. Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy: This aims to improve disruptions to your biological or social rhythms (such as sleep disturbances and relationship issues).

People with bipolar disorder fluctuate from feeling down and depressed to feeling super-charged or manic. The disorder used to be called manic depression or manic-depressive illness. However, nowadays, several types of bipolar disorder are recognized: bipolar I, bipolar II, cyclothymic disorder, mixed features, and rapid-cycling disorder. What are the Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder? Symptoms vary among people with bipolar disorder, depending on what type of bipolar disorder they have. All have slightly different symptoms. Symptoms reflect mood opposites and may include: Periods of high or irritable mood High energy levels Scattered and unproductive activity sometimes with painful or embarrassing consequences Little, if any, need for sleep Thinking that is out of step with reality Psychotic symptoms, such as false beliefs (delusions) or false perceptions (hallucinations) Very low mood Deep depression Self-loathing Feelings of hopelessness or despair Refusal to get out of bed. Some people only develop milder symptoms of mania without psychotic symptoms. This is called hypomania. People who don’t have full blown episodes of mania are more likely to have bipolar II disorder. These mood swings are much more severe than the normal ups and downs most people go through. In between mood swings, most people with bipolar disorder can lead relatively normal lives. The time spent in each mood state (ie, mania or depression) varies depending on the type of bipolar disorder but can range from days to months. The severity of the mood state can also vary significantly, with some people only ever experiencing mild symptoms. What Causes Bipolar Disorder? Although the exact cause is unknown, there does seem to be a genetic link, and you are more likely to get bipolar disorder if you have another family member with the condition. Symptoms are often triggered by a stressful situation or circumstance. This may take the form of a relationship breakdown; physical, sexual, or emotional abuse; money problems; or the death of a close family member or loved one. Symptoms are thought to be due to changes in the balance of some neurotransmitters in the brain, specifically noradrenaline, serotonin, and dopamine. It can be hard to recognize bipolar disorder initially. During a manic phase, a person with bipolar disorder may be incredibly fun to be around. However, as the condition progresses, these manic episodes become more extreme. Some people with bipolar disorder only experience slight mania and are mainly depressed. Misdiagnosis as depression is common. If an antidepressant is prescribed without a mood stabilizer, it will often catapult the person into a full-on manic state. Recognizing bipolar illness is important for treatment, as mood stabilizing agents are the best type of medication. How is Bipolar Disorder Treated? Bipolar disorder can be treated. For best results, medication needs to be combined with therapy sessions and the instigation of good routines. The most effective treatment for bipolar disorder is a mood stabilizing agent. These medications even out the troughs and the peaks of mood swings to keep you on a more even keel. Other treatments may include antipsychotics or antidepressants. Medications should be combined with nonpharmacological treatments, such as: Cognitive-behavioral therapy: This looks into any negative thought patterns you may have and challenges them in order to change your behavior. Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy: This aims to improve disruptions to your biological or social rhythms (such as sleep disturbances and relationship issues). Family focused therapy: This involves your family in your treatment, educating them and allowing them to support you fully.",,,https://www.drugs.com/cons/zyprexa-intramuscular.html,https://www.drugs.com/condition/bipolar-disorder.html

Interactions Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.

Follow your doctor’s dosage recommendations closely. The following medicines can make zopiclone less effective: Some medicines for epilepsy such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin Rifampicin (an antibiotic) - for infections St John’s Wort (a herbal medicine) - for mood swings and depression This medication can change the levels of liver enzymes shown up in blood tests.

Pregnancy and breastfeeding Zopiclone is not recommended during pregnancy. If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Taking zopiclone during pregnancy may affect your baby. Some studies have shown that there may be an increased risk of cleft lip and palate (sometimes called “harelip”) in the newborn baby. Reduced fetal movement and fetal heart rate variability may occur after taking zopiclone during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. If zopiclone is taken at the end of pregnancy or during labour, your baby may show muscle weakness, a drop in body temperature, difficulty feeding and breathing problems (respiratory depression). If this medicine is taken regularly in late pregnancy, your baby may develop physical dependence and may be at risk of developing withdrawal symptoms such as agitation or shaking. In this case the newborn should be closely monitored during the postnatal period. Do not take zopiclone if you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Small amounts of this medication may pass into breast milk. If you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking any medicine.
